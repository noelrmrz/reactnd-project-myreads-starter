# MyReads Project

This is my finalized version of Udacity's React Fundamentals course first project. It is a book-tracker React App that allows the user to search for books and add them to their desired shelf.

## Installation

install all project dependencies with
```bash
npm install
'''
start the development server with 
```bash
npm start
```
